This is the code from the paper "An efficient sinogram-domain fully convolutional interpolation network for sparse-view CT reconstruction".

The CT data of 256×256 is used to prevent file oversizing.

The model can be retrained by running mymodel_sino.py. You can also run mytest_sino_256.py directly to get the reconstruction results of the model.

In the 256×256 folder, there are some model parameters that have already been trained.

The Data folder is missing the A matrix, which can be generated by compute_A in this project.
