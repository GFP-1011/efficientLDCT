# efficient_LDCT
The code was written based on Matlab 2020a.

This is the filtered back-projection module in the network structure proposed in the paper "An efficient sinogram-domain fully convolutional interpolation network for sparse-view CT reconstruction". 

The A matrix and w_b filter can be obtained by running the test.m file.

The original A-matrix is for back-projecting a 512×512 CT image from 605×360 projection data.

The projection data is obtained by Matlab's "fanbeam" function.

The CT image is generated by the "phantom" function to generate a 512×512 Sheep-Logan image.

If you need other sizes of the projection process A-matrix, you can modify the parameters of the above function.
